# Quzer Tokenizer

Quzer is an experimental **Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)** tokenizer written in Python. It supports multilingual UTF-8 text, including Hindi, English, punctuation, and whitespace handling. This is the **first iteration** of a custom tokenizer project, designed with flexibility in mind â€” it's not production-ready yet, but serves as a strong starting point for further development.

- Extraction of multi-byte character ranges (Hindi, etc.)
